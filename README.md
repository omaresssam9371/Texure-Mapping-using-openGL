# Robotic Body animations with textures


## Objectives
The main target of this project is:
* Applying three different types of animations to a full-robotic body.
* Loading different external objects.
* Applying texture mapping to the floor with different options.
* Applying Lighting & Coloring concept
* Make an interaction between the robotic body and an object.

## Basic Usage (Keyboard Shortcuts)
Using the keyboard in upper or lower case, you could test the movement of the body and its animation.
##### 1. Animations:
* Walking Forward : `'d'`
* Walking Backward :`'a'`
* Jumping Over :`'l'`
* Kick :`'k'`

##### 2. Body Transformations:
* Rotate the whole body in the left and right direction: `'B'` and `'b'`
* Moving the left and right shoulder aside: `'y'` and `'r'`
* Moving the left and right shoulder forward: `'u'` and `'t'`
* Moving the left and right elbow: `'h'` and `'f'`
* Moving the left and right leg: `'z'` and `'g'`
* Moving the left and right knee: `'x'` and `'v'`

##### 3. Camera Movements:    
* Right: '&rarr;'
* Left: '&larr;'
* Up: '&uarr;'
* Down: '&darr;'
* Zoom In: `'='`
* Zoom Out: `'-'`
